      <p>
        Tucker High is conducting a drive to collect old and used batteries. Many types of batteries contain hazardous materials which can lead to environmental damage if they are disposed of incorrectly. By recycling, we can deal with these substances safely and aid in preserving nonrenewable resources. If you bring in batteries, you can help to prevent heavy metals and other toxins from leeching into the ground and polluting our ecosystem.

      <h3><span>Batteries and the environment</span></h3>
      <p>
        Discarded batteries can have wide-reaching impacts on the health of the environment. In order to produce electricity, batteries often contain dangerous chemicals required for these sorts of reactions. As they age, these chemicals can leak out of the battery and lead to health issues in many organisms. If these chemicals reach water supplies they can lead to widespread damage. Some of these materials are even combustable, exploding when they come in contact with fire or excessive heat. In order to keep ourselves and our environment safe, we must properly deal with electronic waste.
	    </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A battery has two main components, an anode and a cathode, between which a reaction occurs causing electrons to travel from one end to the other. During the construction of a battery, the use of heavy metals and other hazardous materials are often necessary. Cadmium, lead and mercury are three examples of metals common in batteries with adverse health effects. Laws have been enacted to try to reduce the quantity of dangerous metals in batteries, but many still contain trace amounts. Although we cannot totally remove toxic substances from batteries, we can properly recycle them so that they can be reused rather than discharged into our ecosystems.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With the usage of batteries comes certain responsibilities. As humans we have an obligation to ensure our environment is clean and safe for our posterity. We must toil to clean the messes which we have wrought regardless of how hopeless or dire the situation may seem. Every small contribution brings us closer to our goal of a green, sustainable world for all.
